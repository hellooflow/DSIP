My CPU model is an Apple M3 chip. It has a total of eight cores, 4 performance-cores and 4 efficiency-cores. I couldn't find the core speed and after some searches online I found Apple Silicon has dynamic frequencies instead of one fixed “core speed.”

The type of RAM I have is LPDDR5, manufactured by Micron. I have a total of 16GB RAM. The speed is not explicitly listed in system report.
